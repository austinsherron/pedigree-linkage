# genetics

- we're trying to figure out probability of an individual inheriting a
  specific allele from an ancestor
- segregation is the occurence of one allele (out of two) being passed from a parent
  to its offspring
- mendellian genetics postulates that segregation probabilities are $\frac{1}{2}$
- the recombination fraction $r$ b/w two loci is the probability that genes
  segregating to the gamete at these loci come from different parents
- the genetic map distance b/w two loci is the expected number of crossovers
  that occur b/w them in a gamete

# Bayesian networks from pedigrees

## types of networks

### segregation network

- provides most detailed description of inheritance relat. in pedigree at
  a single locus
- to construct
	- for each individual, $i$, there are two nodes
		- these nodes represent the maternally/paternally inherited genese
	- the underlying random variables can be any of the $a$ allelic types in
	  the system
	- $0$ labels maternal inheritance
	- $1$ labels paternal inheritance
	- for each non-founder, arcs are directed from two father genes to the 
	  paternal gene, and from two mother genes to the maternal gene
	- segregation indicators are added as parents of each gene node
		- these are binary nodes that are valued $0$ if maternal gene
		  was inherited, and $1$ if paternal gene was inherited
	- laws of inheritance can be encoded by letting segregation indicators be
	  independent with transmission probabilities

### allele network

- often unnecessary to keep track of all detail in seg. network
- reduce seg. network to allele network
	- remove segregation nodes/arcs
	- conditional prob. distributions can be of allelic types can be easily
	  derived 

### genotype network

- pedigree like graph (DAG)
- each node represents the random variable assigning a genotype to an
  individual $i$
- must ensure that genotype of individual $i$, $G_i$, is conditionally
  independent of the genotypes of non-descendents, given the genotypes
  of his parents
	- in contrast to the previous networks described, this only holds
	  under Mendellian genetics
- although this network is less visually complex than other networks, a price
  must be paid in expresivity
	- Mendellian inheritance model is mandatory
	- genotypes $G_i$ must assume one of $a$ allelic states, as opposed to 
	  complete $\frac{a(a + 1)}{2}$

## adding Phenotype information to networks

- add extra nodes where phenotype info is available
	- this node has same parents as genotype

# performing computation

## compilation

1. convert Bayesian network to undirected graph by removing edge direction
   and marrying parent nodes
2. triangulate graph by adding fill-in edges to graph until all cycles 
   involving more than three nodes have chords
3. connect cliques of triangulated graph such that it forms a junction tree
4. load junction tree
5. incorporate observations
